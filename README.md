# sphinx

Made for a friend, sphinx allows the website maker to have a scroll effect on images that can only be described as "the Star Wars intro, but towards you."

The system could be described as a front-end API, similar to jQuery. It uses jQuery, but if you have a pure-JavaScript way to do it, by all means fork the project, make it, and make a pull request!
